# Neighbourhood-Prediction-for-College-Students

> In the fast moving, effort-intense environment that a student inhabits, it’s a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while, for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads. 

> This is an idea, a concept for developing a recommender system for college students to help them search affordable housing and get neighbourhood with nearest to home exprience.
